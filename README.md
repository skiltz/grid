GRID
Game & Roms Information Database

This intent to replace MAWS and provaide a lot of informations about non-mame roms/games.

So for compatibility:
 /dinfo/$(driver_name).html
 /ninfo/$(set_name).html
 
And Grids WEB2.0 format:
 /$(system)/$(set_name)
 /$(system)/$(year)
 /$(year)
 /$(game)
 ...
 
I also want to provide a generator of DATs files:
 /tools/generator/dat/last_mame.dat
 /tools/generator/dat/last_cheat_mame.dat
 /tools/generator/dat/last_hisory_mame.dat
 /tools/generator/dat/...
 /tools/generator/list/1p_mame.txt
 /tools/generator/list/...
 /tools/generator/xml/...
 /tools/romident
 
And an Adminitration/ Users interface.

 
This application is based on [MEAN](http://mean.io/).
